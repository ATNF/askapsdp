The software in this "3rdParty" directory is not part of ASKAPsoft, the scripts
exist to fetch and build the 3rd party software as a convenience only.

In some of the subdirectories there are patches that are applied to the packages
prior to building. These patches are licensed under same license as the
associated 3rd party software package.
