     * Common interface which each component in the ASKAP online system needs

     * interface a component shall provide one ore more services. The interface
     * to these services is component specific and hence is not defined here,
     * however the lifecycle and availability of these services does relate to
     * the component state model and is discussed in the comments below.
     *
     * The behaviour of a component is expected to be as follows:
     * 
     * UNLOADED - When in the unloaded state the component shall provide this
     * administrative interface. i.e. its implementation of IComponent. However
     * its service interfaces shall not be available for calling and the
     * component shall be in a mostly uninitialized state.
     *
     * STANDBY - When in the standby state the component shall provide this
     * administrative interface but would usually also have created its
     * internal objects such that a self test could be performed. Howevever
     * its service interfaces shall not be available for calling.
     *
     * ONLINE - When in the online state the component shall provide this
     * administrative interface and shall also provide all services interfaces
     * for calling.
     *
     * The state transitions can be thought of in the following manner:
     *
     * Startup/Shutdown - These two transitions are essentially responsible
     * for creation and destruction of the services the component provides.
     * 
     * Activate/Deactivate - These two transitions make available/unavailable 
     * the services in the Ice locator service (registry).
