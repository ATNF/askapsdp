// structures above describe the calibration solutions as such (i.e. a number of parameters for a given time)
// There could be a situation when parameters corresponding to different antenna/beam (indexed by JonesIndex) were
// determined at a different time. Therefore, it would be handy to have a buffer of the parameters which are actually
// applied (it may be a responsibility of another piece of code to poll the database and populate this buffer with 
// the most recent solutions for every calibration parameter. The frontend would access this buffer and just apply
// all values. In the future, the structure is likely to change, because it should be aligned with the actual architecture.
// Interfaces below are given as an example or a starting point. They essentially pass the same information as the interfaces
// given above but in somewhat transposed form

// status enum for a calibration parameter
// DEFAULT - the appropriate parameter has a default value (i.e. 1.0 for gains), neither automatic calibration pipeline, nor
//           manual adjustment was done. The appropriate time field is meaningless.
// USERDEFINED - the value is set by operator (or any actor other than the calibration pipeline) at the given time. Do we need
//               a special option which ensures that the appropriate value is not be overwritten by the calibration pipeline?
// DERIVED - the value is a result of the calibration pipeline execution at the given time and it is considered to be valid
// FAILED - the pipeline failed to determine the value for some reason. This option is present here for consistency, although the
//          merging logic should probably keep the previous value/status for the given antenna/beam if the solution for an update
//          fails for some reason. The time field shows when the solution for an update has been attempted.
// INVALID - the value is invalidated by some other mechanism, i.e. the operator intervention. The merging logic should probably keep
//           it invalid when the next solution arrives, unlike the FAILD case which should be replaced by the new soltuion if it is
//           valid. The frontend behavior may also be different in this case (i.e. it may flag this beam/antenna in the dataset
