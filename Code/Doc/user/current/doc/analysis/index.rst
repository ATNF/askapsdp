Source-Finding Documentation
============================

The source-finding and analysis package supports analysis of processed
radio synthesis observations, including source detection and
extraction, profile fitting, and writing to the database. This package
is a reimplementation of the source-finding algorithms of Duchamp,
with an emphasis on the processing of ASKAP-scale data sets, and
providing the functionality required by the Survey Science Projects.
