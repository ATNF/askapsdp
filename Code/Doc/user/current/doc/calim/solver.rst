Solvers
=======

.. image:: figures/solver_diagram.png

A number of solvers are available in ASKAPsoft. For imaging purposes only specialized image solvers
are generally used, although generic SVD-based linear solver (see the diagram above) can be used
with (very small) images as well (some change to the code may be required as this is not a normal
use case). The *solver* parset parameter defines the type of the image solver to use with the choice
between *Dirty*, *and Clean*. The *Dirty* solver just inverts the data (takes the normal equations
and simply divides the data vector by the diagonal of the normal matrix. This is analogous to making
the dirty image or a linear mosaic of dirty images), while the Clean performs minor cycle cleaning.
If multiple beams and/or fields are present in the dataset (and mosaicing gridders (see
:doc:`gridder` for details) are used), joint deconvolution is always preformed (individual
deconvolution is not supported).

The Restore solver is somewhat special. It is executed behind the scene with very minimal setup
required from the user (the same parameters are generally used as for the cleaning solver). Restore
solver is described separately in the :doc:`cimager`.

Common Parameters

Parameters for all solvers:

+-------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
|**Parameter**      |**Type**      |**Default**   |**Description**                                         |
+===================+==============+==============+========================================================+
|solver             |string        |none          |Selection of solver. Specify either "Clean" or "Dirty"  |
+-------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
|verbose            |string        |"true"        |True enables lots of output                             |
+-------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
|tolerance          |float         |0.1           |cutoff value given as a fraction of the largest diagonal|
|                   |              |              |element. The linear system describing interferometric   |
|                   |              |              |measurement is inverted approximately, assuming that the|
|                   |              |              |matrix is diagonal, i.e. the right-hand side is divided |
|                   |              |              |by the appropriate diagonal element (which is a         |
|                   |              |              |weight). If diagonal is smaller than this tolerance     |
|                   |              |              |multiplied by the largest diagonal element, the         |
|                   |              |              |right-hand side instead is either divided by the largest|
|                   |              |              |diagonal element to get the result or the result is set |
|                   |              |              |to zero. This is controlled by **weightcutoff**         |
|                   |              |              |parameter. For images it means that areas with low      |
|                   |              |              |weight (i.e. a mosaic edge) are not boosted up. In      |
|                   |              |              |addition to weight truncation, all pixels with the      |
|                   |              |              |weight below cutoff are normally masked out. The        |
|                   |              |              |**weightcutoff.clean** parameter allows to assign mask  |
|                   |              |              |corresponding to weight truncation. This allows         |
|                   |              |              |S/N-based cleaning to happen, if the peak of S/N is     |
|                   |              |              |realised outside the nominal field of view.             |
+-------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
|weightcutoff       |string        |truncate      |Either "zero" or "truncate". This parameter controls    |
|                   |              |              |what actually happens for values below cutoff defined by|
|                   |              |              |the **tolerance** parameter. If **zero** is given, the  |
|                   |              |              |appropriate values are set to zero. For **truncate**,   |
|                   |              |              |the values are divided by the largest diagonal.         |
+-------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
|weightcutoff.clean |bool          |false         |This parameter defines whether the values below cutoff  |
|                   |              |              |are masked out or not. By default, the are masked out   |
|                   |              |              |and so S/N-based clean never finds optima among these   |
|                   |              |              |values. If this parameter is true, the mask is actually |
|                   |              |              |sqrt(tolerance), which corresponds to truncation of the |
|                   |              |              |diagonal during normalisation. This potentially allows  |
|                   |              |              |cleaning to happen, if no peak of the S/N is realised   |
|                   |              |              |among these values.                                     |
+-------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------+


Parameters **verbose** and **tolerance** have **solver.Clean** or **solver.Dirty** prefix. Although verbose is
understood by dirty solver, there is currently no effect. **Dirty** solver doesn't require any additional
parameters (but one can also set up a preconditioner described in the following section with the dirty solver).
Additional parameters understood by the **Clean** solver are given in the following section. 

Clean Solver Parameters
-----------------------

All parameters given in the next table have **solver.Clean** prefix (i.e. Cimager.solver.Clean.algorithm) or
Cimager.solver.Clean.scales. The *Clean* solver with algorithm set to "Basisfunction" is an improved version
of the casacore *LatticeCleaner*. Most importantly, it supports use of a patch in the deconvolution. This
decreases memory use and run time by approximately the ratio of pixels in the patch to pixels in the image.

Parameters of preconditoners
----------------------------

Normal matrix can optionally be transformed by the preconditioning operator before equations are solved.
This step can regularise the matrix and improve the quality of the solution. It is the ASKAPsoft way to
implement weighting in imaging (e.g. uniform, robust) which does not require an additional pass over the
data. The following preconditioners are currently implemented: **Wiener**, **NormWiener**, **Robust** and **GaussianTaper**.

They are described below along with the available parameters. The parameters need a **preconditioner.preconditionerName**
prefix, but without the **solver** prefix (i.e. **Cimager.preconditioner.Wiener.noisepower**), although
technically preconditioning step is done in solver. When defined this way, the same parameters can be reused
in the *restore solver*. The table below contains the description of individual parameters (names starts with
**preconditionerName**)
