ccalibrator
===========

The ccalibrator program performs calibration in a parallel/distributed environment
or on a single computer system. The software leverages MPI, however can be run on
a simple laptop or a large supercomputer.

Running the program
-------------------

It can be run with the following command, where "config.in" is a file containing
the configuration parameters described in the next section. ::

   $ <MPI wrapper> ccalibrator -c config.in

Parallel/Distributed Execution
------------------------------
The program is distributed and used a master/worker pattern to distribute and manage work.
Please refer to the section entitled *Parallel/Distributed Execution* in the :doc:`cimager`
as parallel execution of the *ccalibrator* is the same as the *cimager*.

Configuration Parameters
------------------------

Parset parameters understood by ccalibrator are given in the following table (all
parameters must have **Ccalibrator** prefix, i.e. **Ccalibrator.dataset**). For a number
of parameters certain keywords are substituted, i.e. **%w** is replaced by the rank and
**%n** by the number of nodes in the parallel case. In the serial case, these special
strings are substituted by 0 and 1, respectively. This substitution allows to reuse the
same parameter file on all nodes of the cluster if the difference between jobs assigned to
individual nodes can be coded by using these keywords (e.g. using specially crafted file
names). If a parameter supports substitution, it is clearly stated in the description. 

The **ccalibrator** is intended to process data from a sufficiently short timescale, where
calibratable unknowns can be assumed to be constant (in the ASKAPsoft approach these
corrections are applied upstream and each calibration cycle corresponds to a separate
execution of the calibration code. At this stage only antenna and beam dependent gain
(without cross-polarisation terms) can be calibrated. Note, that the code is still
experimental and has a number of parameters hard coded.

The output file with the result has a parset format understood by **Cimager**. This output
file is called **result.dat** and has complex-valued (stored as 2-element double vectors
of real and imaginary parts) keywords named like **gain.g11.x.b** and **gain.g22.y.c**,
where **x** and **y** are 0-based antenna numbers, **b** and **c** are 0-based beam
numbers and **g11**, **g22** corresponds to the first and second polarisations (in the
frame of the measurement). 
 
A number of other parameters allowing to narrow down the data selection are understood.
They are given in [:doc:`data_selection`] and should also have the **Ccalibrator** prefix.
