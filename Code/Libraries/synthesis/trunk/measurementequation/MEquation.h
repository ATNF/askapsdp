/// MEquation: Represent a parametrized imaging equation. An MEquation 
/// is constructed with two sets of parameters. The parameters
/// can be updated subsequently. The MEquation can do two principal things
///    - calculate data (passed via a data accessor)
///    - transpose residual data back to the parameter space
///
/// These two things can be combined in a calcDerivatives step to allow calculation
/// of gradients for parameters. The parameters may then be solved for by
/// an MESolver class.
/// 
/// There are two classes of parameters - regular parameters which are single values
/// doubles andd image parameters (usually a TempImage of 
/// floats with coordinates). The image pixels are treated homogeneously
/// so that a derivative of chi-squared with respect to the image is itself an image.
/// Note that this split is an optimization - logically one could define a regular
/// parameter for each pixel of an image. However, this would be extremely tedious
/// AND inefficient.
