/// IDataIterator: an interface to the data iterator with
/// associated buffers. See the description of IConstDataIterator
/// for more details. Buffers are the visibility chunks conformant
/// to the data pointed to by the IDataIterator, but with a read/write access. 
/// They are managed by the DataSource object and will not be destroyed
/// when the iterator goes out of scope. All iterators created from the same
/// DataSource object work with the same buffers. The user is responsible
/// for synchronization, if a simultanous access to the same buffer is
/// implemented in a parallel environment.
