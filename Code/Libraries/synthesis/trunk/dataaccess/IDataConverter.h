/// IDataConverter: Interface to described on-the-fly conversions requested
/// from the data source object. The polymorphism will allow a high performance
/// implementation in the future, i.e. bypassing conversionsi, if the data
/// appear in the requested frame/units up front. However, implementation of
/// this optimization will be deferred until the very latest stages. A
/// single converter class is expected to work for most of the cases.
///
/// The main idea is to supply a DataConverter and DataSelector when
/// an iterator is requested from the DataSource object. The iterator will
/// return the data in the requested frame/units.
