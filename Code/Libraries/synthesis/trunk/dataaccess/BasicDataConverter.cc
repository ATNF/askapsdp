/// BasicDataConverter: An implementation of the data converter
/// (IDataConverter interface). The intention is to use it in conjunction
/// with the table based implementation of the data accessor. However,
/// it looks at this stage that this class is relatively general and can be
/// used with any implementation of the data accessor layer. One may want to
/// write a different implementation to achieve a better optimization, which
/// may be specific to a particular DataSource.
///
/// The main idea is to supply a DataConverter and DataSelector when
/// an iterator is requested from the DataSource object. The iterator will
/// return the data in the requested frame/units. The end user interacts
/// with the IDataConverter interface only.
