Introduction
============

Welcome to the user documentation for the ASKAP Central Processor. These pages contain
documentation for the commissioning scientists and early-science users interested in
carrying out calibration, imaging, and analysis of ASKAP data products.

The tools documented here are not intended to provide end-to-end data analysis capabilities,
instead they are components of the ASKAP processing pipeline exposed such that users can
invoke them directly. For more information on (including the scope of) the ASKAP processing
pipelines please refer to the document entitled *ASKAP Science Processing (ASKAP-SW-0020)*.

Rather than read the documentation set from start to finish, it is suggested users first
read the :doc:`../platform/index` to setup their environment and gain an understanding of
platform and execution environment. Then users can move to the :doc:`../tutorials/index`
for a guided tour of some basic data processing, then finally move to the other sections
to gain a detailed understanding of the specific programs used in the tutorials.
