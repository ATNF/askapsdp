cbpcalibrator Documentation
===========================

The ccalibrator program performs calibration in a parallel/distributed environment
or on a single computer system. The software leverages MPI, however can be run on
a simple laptop or a large supercomputer. 

The cbpcalibrator program is a specialised tool for bandpass calibration. It is closely
related to **ccalibrator** (see :doc:`ccalibrator`) and performs one of its functions,
bandpass calibration, in an optimised fashion. The program can be run in a parallel/distributed
environment or on a single computer system. It automatically distributes the work between
multiple MPI ranks, if used on a supercomputer, with no parameter change required for the user. 
Unlike **ccalibrator**, this tool 

      * solves for bandpass only
      * works only with preaveraging calibration approach
      * does not support multiple chunks in time (i.e. only one solution is made for the whole dataset)
      * does not support data distribution except per beam 
      * does not support a distributed model (e.g. with individual workers dealing with individual Taylor terms)
      * does not require exact match between number of workers and number of channel chunks, data are dealt with
        serially by each worker with multiple iterations over data, if required.
      * solves normal equations at the worker level in the parallel case

This specialised tool matches closely BETA needs and will be used for BETA initially (at least until we converge
on the best approach to do bandpass calibration). The lifetime of this tool is uncertain at present. In many
instances the code is quick and dirty, just to suit our immediate needs.

Running the program
-------------------

It can be run with the following command, where "config.in" is a file containing
the configuration parameters described in the next section. ::

   $ <MPI wrapper> cbpcalibrator -c config.in

Parallel/Distributed Execution
------------------------------

The program is distributed and used a master/worker pattern to distribute and manage work.
Unlike *cimager* and *ccalibrator*, this program manages distribution of workload 
implicitly (c.f. with the section entitled *Parallel/Distributed Execution* in the :doc:`cimager`,
where the user is responsible for explicit workload distribution). If executed in a 
parallel environment (i.e. two or more MPI ranks are available), the program will automatically
distribute beams and channels across all available workers is uniformly as possible
(i.e. it pays to have nbeam x nchan / integer_number + 1 MPI ranks available) and the master 
will be responsible for collating and storing the results. The dataset(s) will be read multiple
times. It is possible to give a separate dataset for each beam. In this case, each dataset will
be read nchan times. 


Configuration Parameters
------------------------

Parset parameters understood by cbpcalibrator are given in the following table (all
parameters must have **Cbpcalibrator** prefix, i.e. **Cbpcalibrator.dataset**). 
Although the substitution rules (e.g. see **%w** and **%n** in :doc:`ccalibrator`)
are supported, their use is not intended.

The results are stored via *calibaccess* interface (see :doc:`calibration_solutions`), however
only casa table option currently supports bandpass products. 

A number of other parameters allowing to narrow down the data selection are understood.
They are given in [:doc:`data_selection`] and should also have the **Cbpcalibrator** prefix.

|calibaccess            |string          |"parset"      |The destination for the calibration solution.    |
|                       |                |              |Note, the default *parset* option does not work  |
|                       |                |              |for this application. Therefore, *table* option  |
|                       |                |              |must be used and calibaccess.table.<params>      |
|                       |                |              |parameters should be defined. For more details   |

The resulting parameters are stored into a solution source (or sink to be exact) as described in :doc:`calibration_solutions`
