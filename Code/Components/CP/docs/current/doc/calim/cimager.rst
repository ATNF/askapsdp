cimager Documentation
=====================

This page provides some details about the cimager program. The purpose of this
software is to perform imaging in a parallel/distributed environment or on a single
computer system. The software leverages MPI, however can be run on a simple laptop
or a large supercomputer.

Running the program
-------------------

It can be run with the following command, where "config.in" is a file containing
the configuration parameters described in the next section. ::

   $ cimager -c config.in


Configuration Parameters
------------------------

Parset parameters understood by imager are given in the following table (all parameters must have **Cimager** prefix, i.e. **Cimager.dataset**). For a number of parameters certain keywords are substituted, i.e. **%w** is replaced by the worker number (rank-1, if there is only one pool of workers) and **%n** by the number of nodes in the parallel case. In the serial case, these special strings are substituted by 0 and 1, respectively. This substitution allows to reuse the same parameter file on all nodes of the cluster if the difference between jobs assigned to individual nodes can be coded by using these keywords (e.g. using specially
crafted file names). Note, if there is more than 1 group of workers (e.g. parallel calculation of Taylor terms), %w index spans the workers in one group rather than the
global pool of workers. This is done to allow the same file name to be used for corresponding worker in different groups (i.e. all Taylor terms are build from the same file). If a parameter supports substitution, it is clearly stated in the description. 

A number of other parameters allowing to narrow down the data selection are understood. They are given in a separate table (see :doc:`data_selection`) and should also have the **Cimager** prefix.
