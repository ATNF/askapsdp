/// The delay tracking is done via DRx by offseting memory read out. The corresponding phase
/// tracking term is applied by this class. The effective LO frequency is not available as
/// part of metadata, but we can deduce it from the sky frequency as ASKAP has a simple
/// conversion chain (the effective LO and the sky frequency of the first channel always have
/// a fixed offset which is hard coded inside this task at the moment - could be made a parameter,
/// if needs to be).
///
/// There are many common steps between this task and CalcUVWTask, but it seems better
/// not to merge phase tracking with the UVW calculator because we wouldn't need it in the long term.
/// For simplicity, this class is derived from UVW calculator class.
