  /// @brief Base component class of the MWSpec composite pattern.

  /// This is the so-called \e component class in the MWSpec composite
  /// pattern (see Gamma, 1995). It is the base class for all MWSpec
  /// classes, both composite and leaf classes. It has data members that are
  /// common to all MWSpec classes.
  ///
  /// The MWSpec objects contain the specification of the BBS steps to
  /// perform in the MW framework. A step can be part of a composite
  /// MWMultiSpec object and the specification in there acts as the default
  /// value of a step. In that way it is possible to create a composite
  /// step object, that can be used with various sky source models.
  ///
  /// The specification is given in a LOFAR .parset file. In there each
  /// step has a name, say XX. Then the \a parset variables <tt>Step.XX.*</tt>
  /// contain the specification of XX.
  /// A composite object is made by specifying the names of the steps it
  /// consists of as <tt>Step.COMP.Steps=["XX", "YY", "ZZ"]</tt>.
  ///
  /// An MWSpec hierarchy needs to be transformed to an MWStep hierarchy
  /// to be able to process the steps. This is done by the derived MWSpecVisitor
  /// class MWSpec2Step.
