/// @section icewrappers_intro Introduction
/// The icewrappers package provides classes and data structures which provide
/// abstraction layer via which central processor can use the ICE middleware
/// without needing to know the details of using ICE.
///
/// This package aims to contain ICE specific code such that a move from ICE to
/// another middleware would involve mainly changes to this package, and little
/// to the users of this package.
