  /// MW messages are transmitted as blobs.
  /// The envelope consist of the basic blob header with type 'mw'. The
  /// blob header defines things like endianness, version, and length.
  /// The envelope also contains the operation type and streamId.
  /// The operation type tells the worker what is has to do.
  /// The streamId is for future use to make it possible to have parallel
  /// work streams in a worker to keep it busy.
  /// The workerId gives the id of the worker.
  ///
  /// The envelope has room for timings. In this way the master can know
  /// how much time it took for a worker to execute a command.
  /// The \a setTimes function can be used to set the timings. It uses
  /// the casa Timer class to get the low-precision elapsed, user, and system
  /// times. The LOFAR NSTimer class is used for high-precision elapsed time.
  ///
  /// The message proper has to be written by the user of this class
  /// into the supplied \a blobStream.
  /// After all data are written, the \a finish function has to be called.
