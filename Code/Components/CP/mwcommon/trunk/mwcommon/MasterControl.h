  /// @brief Master control of a distributed process.

  /// This class does the overall control of the master/worker framework.
  /// It defines the basic operations (see the enum) that can be done by the
  /// workers.
  ///
  /// Its operations are as follows:
  /// <ol>
  ///  <li> The \a setInitInfo function sends the basic info to all
  ///       workers like the name of the VDS to be used.
  ///  <li> The \a setWorkDomain function defines the work domain info
  ///       in a WorkDomainSpec object.
  ///  <li> The processSteps function does the actual processing.
  ///       It loops over the entire observation domain in work domain chunks.
  ///       For each work domain it loops over the steps to be processed.
  ///       This is done by using the MasterControl as a visitor to an MWStep.
  ///  <li> After all steps are processed, it sends a quit command to the
  ///       workers.
  /// </ol>
  /// As said above, a step is processed by using the MasterControl as
  /// an MWStepVisitor object. Usually step maps directly to an operation
  /// and prcoessing the step simply consists of sending a single command
  /// to the workers.
  /// However, in case of a solve it is more ivolved.
  /// It consists of sending multiple operations to prediffers and solver
  /// and testing if the solver has converged. This is all handled in the
  /// \a visitSolve function.
  ///
  /// Instead of using MasterControl as the visitor, it might also be
  /// possible to pass a visitor object to the MasterControl. However,
  /// apart from processing the steps the MasterControl is doing hardly
  /// anything at all, so it might be better to have anther XXXControl
  /// class resembling this one.
  /// (It might be better to rename MasterControl to BBSControl as it is
  /// modeled after the BBSKernel functionality).
