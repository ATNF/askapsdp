  /// This class acts as the MW communication mechanism in memory.
  /// It makes it possible to use the MW framework in a single process
  /// which makes debugging easier.
  ///
  /// It is used in the same way as a SocketConnection or MPIConnection, but
  /// because everything is synchronous in a single process, a WorkerProxy
  /// object must be registered with the connection. Its \a handleData function
  /// function is immediately called when data are sent.
  /// The result is stored in a buffer in the MemConnection object, which
  /// can thereafter be read.
  /// After a read the buffer is cleared to ensure it is not read twice
  /// (as is also the case in a 'normal' connection).
