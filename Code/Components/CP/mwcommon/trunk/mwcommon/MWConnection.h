  /// @brief Abstract base class for all MWConnections.

  /// This class defines the base class for classes to transport data.
  /// Actually, the data transport is done between two MWConnection objects
  /// of the same type.
  ///
  /// The data are packed in LOFAR Blob objects to support heterogeneous
  /// machines (with different endianness). It also makes it possible to
  /// version the data to make future upgrades possible. Finally as blob
  /// contains a length making it easily possible to support varying length
  /// messages.
  ///
  /// To support varying length messages for both socket and MPI connections,
  /// the length can be determined first. If found, the message length is
  /// known. Otherwise the blob header is read to find the message length.
  /// This is needed because in MPI a message has to be read in one receive,
  /// while sockets have no direct means to determine the message length.
  ///
  /// Derived classes (e.g. MPIConnection) implement the concrete transport
  /// classes.
