/// @brief Gridder adapter to do snap-shot imaging 
/// @details We can handle non-coplanarity via snap-shot imaging. For an approximately co-planar 
///     array the effect of w-term at a short time interval is equivalent to a shift. This gridder
///     uses an accessor adapter to monitor changes of the best-fit plane in the u,v,w-spce. If the
///     departure from the previously fitted plane exceeds the tolerance, the image is regridded to
///     a proper coordinate system (taken the shift out). This is an adapter, which can work with
///     any ASKAPsoft gridder. The real gridder, passed as a parameter during construction, does all 
///     the gridding job, so the snap-shot imaging can be combined with w-projection or any other
///     algorithm. The main driver for snap-shot imaging is an attempt to decrease the support size
///     of convolution functions (largely caused by w-projection).
