/// @brief accessor adapter fitting the best w-plane 
///
/// @details This is an adapter to data accessor which fits a plane
/// into w=w(u,v) and corrects w to represent the distance from
/// this plane rather than the absolute w-term. The planar component
/// can be taken out as a shift in the image space. The adapter provides
/// methods to obtain the magnitude of the shift (i.e. fit coefficients).
/// This class also checkes whether the deviation from the plane is within the
/// tolerance set-up at the construction. A new plane is fitted if necessary. 
/// @note An exception is thrown if the layout is so non-coplanar, that the
/// required tolerance cannot be met.
