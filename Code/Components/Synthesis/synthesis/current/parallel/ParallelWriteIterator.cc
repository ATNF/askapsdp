/// @brief client iterator implementing parallel write
/// @details This is an implementation of data iterator
/// (see Base/accessors) which runs in a particular worker to
/// allow parallel writing of visibilities. Read operation is not
/// supported for simplicity. The server has to be executed at the
/// master side at the same time. It gathers the data (and distributes jobs
/// between workers). The decision was made to have this class in synthesis/parallel
/// rather than Base/accessors because it uses master-working specific code and
/// is not a general purpose class.
