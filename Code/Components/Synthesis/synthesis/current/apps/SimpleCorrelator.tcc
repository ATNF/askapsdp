/// @brief This is a template providing a basic X-step of a correlator
/// @details For BETA-3 experiments we want to be able to correlate the data
/// in software. This templated class implements a core functionality of a
/// single baseline correlator computing just the correlation matrix. The
/// interface is quite generic, so we can use it for both on-the-fly and 
/// off-line correlation. In addition, the dependency on other libraries has
/// been minimised (so we can integrate the class with the recording stage, if
/// we decide to do so later on).
