/// @brief A measurement equation, which generates a gaussian noise.
/// @details It is required for simulations to be able to add noise to
/// the simulated visibilities. To do it via measurement equations, one
/// has to create a composite measurement equation via SumOfTwoMEs class
/// with one of the input measurement equations set to an instance of
/// GaussianNoiseME defined here. If we need various similar classes the
/// approach probably needs to be changed to something similar to
/// CalibrationME template/effect classes.
/// @note The random number generator is a member of this class. In a 
/// parallel environment this would lead to a number of independent
/// generators used and to the same sequence generated in parallel 
/// branches of code. One needs a global solution (with an internode 
/// comminicaton on the cluster for a proper simulation of random numbers).
