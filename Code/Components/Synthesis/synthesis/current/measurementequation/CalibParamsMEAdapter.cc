/// @brief Measurement equation adapter filling calibration parameters on demand
/// @details This is an adapter intended to be used when calibration effects
/// are simulated. It implements IMeasurementEquation interface, but only
/// predict method is expected to be used. An exception is thrown if 
/// one requests normal equations to be computed with this class. The predict
/// method checks whether new antenna/beam combinations are present in the 
/// current visibility chunk. It then creates new parameters (this class follows
/// the name convension enforced by accessors::CalParamNameHelper, but this 
/// behavior can be overridden in derived classes, if necessary) and updates
/// the existing ones using calibration solution source supplied at construction.
/// After parameters are created, the predict method of the wrapped measurement
/// equation is called to predict visibilities.
