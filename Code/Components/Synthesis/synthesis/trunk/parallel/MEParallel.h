		/// @brief Support for parallel algorithms using the measurement equation

		/// @details Support for parallel applications using the measurement equation
		/// classes. An application is derived from this abstract base. The model used is that the
		/// application has many prediffers and one solver, running in separate MPI processes
		/// or in one single thread. The solver is the master so the number of processes
		/// is one more than the number of prediffers. Each prediffer is currently given
		/// a separate data set.
		///
		/// The steps are:
		/// (a) define an initial model and distribute to all prediffers
		/// (b) calculate the normal equations for each data set (this part is
		/// distributed across the prediffers)
		/// (c) send all normal equations to the solver for merging
		/// (d) solve the merged normal equations
		/// (e) distribute the model to all prediffers and return to (b)
		///
		/// The caller is responsible for ensuring that the model is transferred correctly 
		/// before a CalcNE and after a SolveNE. For example:
		/// @code
		///		for (int cycle=0;cycle<nCycles;cycle++)
		///		{
		///			imager.os() << "*** Starting major cycle " << cycle << " ***" << std::endl;
		///			if(cycle>0) imager.receiveModel();
		///			imager.calcNE();
		///			imager.solveNE();
		///			// Broadcast the model
		///			if (cycle<(nCycles-1)) imager.broadcastModel();
		///		}
		/// @endcode
		/// The normal equations are transferred automatically between the calcNE and solveNE
		/// steps so the called does not need to be concerned about that.
		///
		/// If the number of nodes is 1 then everything occurs in the same process with
		/// no overall for transmission of model or normal equations.
