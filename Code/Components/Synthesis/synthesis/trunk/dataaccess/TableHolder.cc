/// @brief A class holding a table object
/// @details A simple implementation of the ITableHolder interface.
/// This class just holds a table object and returns
/// a reference to it by demand. Although, it is cheap to copy Table
/// object itself due to the reference semantics, it seems necessary to have
/// access to some derived data (e.g. some information from the feed table,
/// or data description table), which are not necessarily cheap to copy.
/// Derived classes will provide required functionality. Building derived
/// information on-demand is also expected to be implemented.
