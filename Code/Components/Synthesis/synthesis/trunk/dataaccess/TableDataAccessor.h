/// @details TableDataAccessor is an implementation of the
/// DataAccessor for original (non-buffered) visibilities, i.e. visibilities
/// in the DATA column of the measurement set. It is working in pair with 
/// the TableDataIterator class. If the measurement set is writable (see
/// construction options in TableDataSource), this class allows to use
/// rwVisibility() method of the interface. An exception is thrown if the shape
/// of the updated visibility cube doesn't match the shape of the DATA column
/// when write is attempted (the write operation is delayed until the iterator
/// is progressed to the next step). Simple selections (i.e. those based on the
/// feed ID, baseline, time range) can be used together with the write operation.
/// However, polarization and spectral selections and on-the-fly averaging
/// are not supported by this class. It is not trivial and probably we don't 
/// even have a use case in CONRAD to support such operations.
