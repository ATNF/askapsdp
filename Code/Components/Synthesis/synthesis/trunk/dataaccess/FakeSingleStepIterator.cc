/// individual accessors. Therefore, it is hard to integrate it with calibration
/// without multiple iterations over the dataset. Converting the code to use
/// accessors is necessary, but seems to be a lot of the job. This iterator is
/// a (temporary) adapter, which just returns supplied accessor as its value.
/// Only one chunk is defined.
