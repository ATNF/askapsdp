/// @brief A structural type joining together ImagingEquation and MultiChunkEquation
/// @details Because we deal with the double inheritance here, we need to overload
/// explicitly predict and calcImagingEquation methods, otherwise the methods
/// in the scimath::Equation tree are left pure abstract. Theoretically, we can
/// get rid of the double inheritance here and the need of this class would 
/// disappear. However, MultiChunkEquation is envisaged to be a temporary
/// class before we start to work with accessors only. Therefore, the inheritance
/// is left double to highlight the future interface 
/// (derived from IMeasurementEquation).
