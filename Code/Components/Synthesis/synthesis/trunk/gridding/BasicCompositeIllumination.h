/// imaging with a synthetic beam. As an implementation of IBasicIllumination interface, 
/// this class provides a method to obtain illumination pattern by populating a pre-defined 
/// grid supplied as a UVPattern object. It looks like handling of illumination patterns
/// inside gridders has to be generalised (i.e. main method should receive a full accessor
/// with all the metadata instead of just the pointing offsets, frequency, etc). Such 
/// transition would definitely require an interface change in this class.
