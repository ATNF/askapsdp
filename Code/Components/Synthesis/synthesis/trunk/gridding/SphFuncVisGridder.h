		/// we should revisit the tradeoffs since the choice to use this was made
		/// about twenty years ago and computers are quite different now.
		///
		/// The spheroidal function has m = 6, alpha = 1 using the rational
		/// approximations discussed by fred schwab in 'indirect imaging'.
		/// The gridding function is (1-nu**2)*grdsf(nu) where nu is the distance
		/// to the edge. the grid correction function is just 1/grdsf(nu) where nu
		/// is now the distance to the edge of the image.
