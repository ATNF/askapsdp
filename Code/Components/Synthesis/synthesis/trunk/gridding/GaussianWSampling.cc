/// @brief Gaussian w-sampling 
/// @details
/// W-dependent gridders support non-linear sampling in the w-space (through WDependentGridderBase).
/// This class implements IWSampling interface and provides gaussian sampling in the w-space. The
/// class is parameterised with a single parameter being the number of w-planes covering 50% of w-term range.
/// Other parameters of the distribution formula 
///
///     y = sign(x)*A*(1-exp(-x*x/(2*sigma*sigma)))
///
/// are derived from this single parameter under assumption that the whole [-wmax,wmax] interval should be sampled,
/// so the first and the last w-planes should always correspond to -wmax and +wmax, and the middle w-plane should always
/// correspond to zero w-term. The gaussian w-sampling may be helpful if we take into account a typical density of 
/// samples in w-space. Some experimentation is needed to find what values of the free parameter are actually useful.
