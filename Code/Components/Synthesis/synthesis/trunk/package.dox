/// @mainpage CONRAD synthesis package
///
/// @section Introduction
/// The synthesis package supports processing of radio synthesis observations,
/// including calibration, editing, and imaging. The emphasis is on the
/// processing of MIRANdA and KAT scale data sets i.e. TBs per hour.
///
/// @section Assumptions and goals
///
/// The large data volumes to be processed require that I/O of data be
/// minimized. Hence the goal is to write algorithms that require only
/// a minimal number of reads and writes. For spectral line processing,
/// our goal is to read the visibility data only once.
///
/// The synthesis package itself is designed to run in one process. 
/// We envisage that OpenMP-type multi-threading may be supported by
/// specialise versions of some of the classes in this package. 
/// Message passing parallel execution is supported in the 
/// @ref parallel classes and in the @ref calim package.
///
/// We assume that the problem can be (and is) partitioned such that the
/// image data always fits in memory during the processing.
///
/// @section Dependencies
/// The synthesis package makes extensive use of the CONRAD @ref fitting 
/// framework. 
///
/// Data access is via a set of classes that make use of the casa measures
/// package. Numerical data are held in casa Arrays (including Vector,
/// Matrix, and Cube). Non-numerical data are usually held in standard
/// containers such as vectors, and maps.
