/// @mainpage ASKAP Central Processor - Correlator Simulator
///
/// @section correlatorsim_intro Introduction
/// The correlatorsim package provides a simulation of the datastreams coming
/// from the ASKAP correlator and Telescope Operating System (TOS).
///
/// The purpose of this software is to simulate the ASKAP correlator for the
/// purposes of testing the central processor. This simulator described here
/// is actually a playback simulator and relies on other software
/// (e.g. csimulator) to actually create a simulated measurement set which
/// will be played back by the software described here.
///
/// @note This package does not provide an externally consumable library & API.
/// This package provides a set of programs.
