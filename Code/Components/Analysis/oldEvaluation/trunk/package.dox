///
/// @section Introduction
/// The evaluation package supports quality evaluation of the results
/// from the analysis package 
///
/// @section Assumptions and goals
///
/// The evaluation package is designed to provide feedback on the 
/// effectiveness of the imaging and source detection. It will be run
/// after the analysis package, using the output of that to compare to
/// either a list of known sources or an input image (in the case of
/// simulated data sets). Positions and fluxes of common sources will 
/// be compared to look for systematic errors.
///
/// @section Dependencies
/// The LOFAR APS package is used to handle Parameter Sets, which
/// control the user inputs.
