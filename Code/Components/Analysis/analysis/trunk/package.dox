///
/// @section Introduction
/// The analysis package supports analysis of processed radio synthesis 
/// observations, including source detection and extraction, profile
/// fitting, and writing to the database. The emphasis is on the
/// processing of ASKAP and KAT scale data sets i.e. TBs per hour.
///
/// @section Assumptions and goals
///
/// As for the synthesis package, the large data volumes to be
/// processed require that I/O of data be minimized. The analysis
/// processes are assumed to be run immediately after the imaging
/// process (synthesis imaging & cleaning).
///
/// We assume that the problem can be (and is) partitioned such that the
/// image data always fits in memory during the processing.
///
/// The analysis package itself is designed to run in one process. 
/// We envisage that OpenMP-type multi-threading may be supported by
/// some classes in this package, to take account of the distributed
/// data. Message passing parallel execution is supported in the 
/// @ref parallelanalysis classes.
///
/// @section Dependencies
/// The analysis package makes extensive use of the Duchamp 3D source
/// finding package to do the source detection and extraction. This
/// package currently only reads FITS data, so
///
/// Source fitting will be largely done by casa Gaussian Fitting
/// routines.
