/// @mainpage ASKAP analysis package
///
/// @section Introduction
/// The analysis package supports analysis of processed radio synthesis 
/// observations, including source detection and extraction, profile
/// fitting, and writing to the database. The emphasis is on the
/// processing of ASKAP-scale data sets i.e. TBs per hour.
///
/// @section Assumptions and goals
///
/// As for the synthesis package, the large data volumes to be
/// processed require that I/O of data be minimized. The analysis
/// processes are assumed to be run immediately after the imaging
/// process (synthesis imaging & cleaning).
///
/// We assume that the problem can be (and is) partitioned such that the
/// image data always fits in memory during the processing.
///
/// The analysis package itself is designed to run in one process. 
/// We envisage that OpenMP-type multi-threading may be supported by
/// some classes in this package, to take account of the distributed
/// data. Message passing parallel execution is supported in the 
/// @ref parallelanalysis classes.
///
/// @section Dependencies
/// The analysis package makes extensive use of the Duchamp 3D source
/// finding package to do the source detection and extraction. While 
/// Duchamp can only read FITS images, there are additional routines 
/// provided by this package to read AIPS++/casa images as well.
///
/// Source fitting is largely done by casa Gaussian Fitting routines.
