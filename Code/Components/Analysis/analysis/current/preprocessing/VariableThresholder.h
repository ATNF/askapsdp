/// @details This class handles all operations related to the
/// calculation and application of a variable detection
/// threshold, as well as the output of maps of the threshold,
/// noise, S/N ratio. The threshold is calculated based on the
/// statistics within a sliding box, so that the noise
/// properties for a given pixel depend only on the pixels
/// within a box (2D or 1D) of a specified size centred on
/// that pixel. The statistics can be calculated based on
/// robust measures (median and MADFM), or traditional
/// mean/standard deviation. The threshold applied is a
/// constant signal-to-noise ratio.
///
/// The maps of various quantities can also be written to CASA images
/// on disk. These quantities include the noise level, the threshold
/// (in flux units), the signal-to-noise ratio
