/// an image when dealing with a catalogue made from fits to that
/// image.

/// @details This class allows one to straightforwardly access the
/// beam information from an image that was used to create a
/// catalogue. The simplest interface to creating a BeamCorrector
/// object is to use the parset, where it looks for the
/// BeamCorrector.Image parameter, being the name of the file in
/// question. It will then read the beam and spatial pixel scale from
/// that image. It can then be used to correct the flux of sources
/// created from the catalogue, converting their flux from Jy to
/// Jy/beam so that they can be placed onto an image.
