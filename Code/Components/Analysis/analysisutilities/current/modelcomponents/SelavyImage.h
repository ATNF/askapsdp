      /// the beam information from an image that was used to create a Selavy
      /// catalogue. The simplest interface to creating a SelavyImage object is
      /// to use the parset, where it looks for the Selavyimage parameter, being
      /// the name of the file in question. It will then read the beam and
      /// spatial pixel scale from that image. It can then be used to correct
      /// the flux of sources created from the catalogue, converting their flux
      /// from Jy to Jy/beam so that they can be placed onto an image.
