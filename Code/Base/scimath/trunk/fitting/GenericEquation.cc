/// @brief Measurement equation without any approximation
/// @details There are two kinds of normal equations currently supported. The
/// first one is a generic case, where the full normal matrix is retained. It
/// is used, e.g. for calibration. The second one is intended for imaging, where 
/// we can't afford to keep the whole normal matrix. In the latter approach, the 
/// matrix is approximated by a sum of diagonal and shift invariant matrices. 
/// This class represents a measurement equation in the general case, where no 
/// approximation to the normal matrix is done. It uses GenericNormalEquation as
/// opposed to ImagingNormalEquation
