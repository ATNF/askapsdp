/// @brief Measurement equation with an approximation used for imaging
/// @details There are two kinds of normal equations currently supported. The
/// first one is a generic case, where the full normal matrix is retained. It
/// is used, e.g. for calibration. The second one is intended for imaging, where 
/// we can't afford to keep the whole normal matrix. In the latter approach, the 
/// matrix is approximated by a sum of diagonal and shift invariant matrices. 
/// This class represents a measurement equation in the latter case with 
/// approximation. It simply serves as a structural element in the class
/// diagram and converts a call to generic calcEquation into a specific call
/// to fill a normal equation class appropriate for imaging.
/// @note Some imaging equations use generic normal equations.
