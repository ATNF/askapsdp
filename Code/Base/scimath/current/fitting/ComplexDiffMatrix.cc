/// @brief A matrix of ComplexDiff classes
/// @details The calibration code constructs normal equations for each
/// row of the data accessor, i.e. a matrix with dimensions nchan x npol.
/// When a design matrix is constructed, all elements of this matrix are
/// treated independently. However, it is better to retain a basic matrix
/// algebra to ensure the code is clear. This class also treats well a
/// possible degenerate dimension (polarisation). Theoretically, 
/// casa::Matrix<ComplexDiff> could be used instead of this class. However,
/// having a separate class allows, in principle, to handle maps of the 
/// parameters at the matrix level and don't duplicate the map search 
/// unnecessarily. Such functionality is in the future plans, but it is
/// hidden behind the interface of this class.
