/// @brief Basic interface to access an image
/// @details This interface class is somewhat analogous to casa::ImageInterface. But it has
/// only methods we need for accessors and allow more functionality to access a part of the image.
/// In the future we can benefit from using this minimalistic interface because it should be 
/// relatively easy to do parallel operations on the same image or even distributed storage.
