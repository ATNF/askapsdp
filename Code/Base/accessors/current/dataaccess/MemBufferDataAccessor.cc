/// @brief an adapter to most methods of IConstDataAccessor
///
/// @details It is sometimes necessary to use a simple cube instead of
/// the full functionality of buffers provided by the read-write accessor.
/// Typically, the need for such class arises if one needs a buffering
/// on each individual iteration and the content of buffers is not required 
/// to be preserved when the corresponding iterator advances. In most cases,
/// a casa::Cube with the same dimensions as that returned by the visibility
/// method can be used. However, it can also be desireable to be able to
/// use existing API accepting a reference to an accessor for this buffer, or,
/// alternatively to pass around this buffer with associated metadata supplied
/// by the original accessor. This adapter can help in both situations.
