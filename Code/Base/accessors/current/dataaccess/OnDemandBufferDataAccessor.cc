/// @brief an adapter to most methods of IConstDataAccessor with buffering
///
/// @details This class is somewhat similar to MemBufferDataAccessor, however it is
/// not as basic. The latter doesn't manage the cube at all and only ensures that it has
/// a conforming size. In contrast, this class returns the existing read-only visibility cube 
/// until a non-const reference is requested (rwVisibility). Then the read-only visibilities are
/// copied to the internal buffer and the reference to this buffer is passed for all later calls
/// to read-write and read-only methods until either the shape changes or discardCache method is
/// called. The intention is to provide a similar functionality for the flagging methos
