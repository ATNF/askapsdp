    /// a smart pointer. 
    /// @note An alternative approach is to ammend the interface
    /// to pass the reference frame as an argument for methods, which perform
    /// the conversions. Time will show which one is better. A change from one
    /// way of solving the problem to another doesn't affect the high level
