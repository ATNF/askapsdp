/// @file IConstDataIterator.cc
/// @brief A read-only iterator across preselected data.
/// @details Each  iteration step is represented by the IDataAccessor
/// interface. The idea is that an iterator object will be obtained via
/// IDataSource which will take care of the actual method to access the
/// data and the source (a MeasurementSet or a stream). Any class
/// controlling data selection is likely to be held by a real
/// implementation of the iterator. However,
/// it will be set up via the IDataSource object and IS NOT a part of this
/// interface.
