/// @file
/// @brief Parset file-based implementation of the calibration solution accessor
/// @details This implementation is to be used with pre-existing code writing/reading
/// the parset directly and with a number of tests. It doesn't implement anything related
/// to bandpass table (and always returns 1. for bandpass and throws an exception if one
/// attempts to write a bandpass). This is because none of the code written so far deals with
/// bandpass tables (and any future code will used in conjunction with more a flexible 
/// implementation, e.g. table-based). This implementation is just to convert the legacy code.
/// There is only one implementation of this class which is used for both reading and writing.
