/// @brief factory creating calibration parameter accessor
/// @details This factory creates an actual instance of the calibration
/// parameter accessor and returns a generic instance via shared pointer.
/// Different implementations are possible: parset-based, casa table-based,
/// ICE-based. We could even load the actual code from a shared library as it
/// is done for gridders (may help to break dependencies). For now this factory
/// method is in calibaccess, but can be moved somewhere else later, especially
/// when an ICE-based implementation is ready to be plugged in.
