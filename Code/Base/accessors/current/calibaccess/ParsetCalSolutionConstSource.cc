/// @brief Parset file-based implementation of the calibration solution source
/// @details This implementation is to be used with pre-existing code writing/reading
/// the parset directly and with a number of tests. It is just to convert the legacy code.
/// There is only one implementation of this class which is used for both reading and writing.
/// Main functionality is implemented in the corresponding ParsetCalSolutionAccessor class.
/// This class just creates an instance of the accessor and manages it.
