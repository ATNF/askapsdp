/// @detail
/// This test simply sends a single message via the IceAppender and ensures
/// it has been received. This test program acts as the Log Archiver, which
/// usually subscribes to he appropriate IceStorm topic and receives the
/// LogEvents.
///
/// The test requires the presence of this file "tIceAppender.log_cfg" which
/// would usually have the following contents:
///
/// @code
/// log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG,REMOTE
///
/// log4j.appender.REMOTE=IceAppender
/// log4j.appender.REMOTE.locator_host=localhost
/// log4j.appender.REMOTE.locator_port=4061
/// log4j.appender.REMOTE.topic=logger
