  /// to group connections to workers of a specific type.
  /// The main reason for having this class is the ability to check if any
  /// connection in the group is ready to receive data (i.e. if the other
  /// side of the connection has sent data). This is done using MPI_Probe
  /// with the tag of the first connection, so all connections in the group
  /// should have the same (and unique) tag.
  ///
  /// @todo Implement getReadyConnection.
