Module :mod:`askap.logging` -- Python logging extensions
========================================================

This module import all of python's built-in logging module and add the
following functionality:

    * :func:`log_debug` - a decorator for logging at the DEBUG level.

.. todo::

    python < 2.6.3 has a bug where::

        from logging import *

    doesn't import all symbols. We can remove the explicit imports once
    everyone is using version above 2.6.2

"""

# pylint: disable-msg=W0401
from logging import *
# python 2.6 now has __all__, which means not everything gets in
# this is a bug fixed in 2.6.3
from logging import config
from logging import handlers
from logging import getLogger, basicConfig, getLevelName

# decorator
def log_debug(func):
    """Logging decorator for quick debugging of function calls and their arguments.
You need to set the logging level to ''DEBUG'' to see these message and
should have a logging instance called ''logger''.

Example::

    from askap.logging import getLogger, log_debug

    # use module name as logger name
    logger = getLogger(__name__)

    class Foo:
        def __init__(self):
            pass

        @log_debug
